## Prerequisites
- [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- React.js
- Axios
- Redux
- Redux-Saga
- [Material.UI](https://mui.com)
- Express 
- Body-Parser
- 'PG'

## Installation
1. Clone this repository for your own access.
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
3. Using the provided `data.sql` file - set up a database with the name `saga_movies_weekend`
4. Open two Terminal Tabs
5. Run `npm run server`  and `npm run client`in your terminal

## Usage
This application is intended to allow users to view movies:
1. Users are able to click on the poster of images on the home page to see a more detailed view of each movie.
2. This detail view allows the user to see the description and genres the movie falls into.
3. Users may search for movies using the search feature. Movies are fetched using the Movie Database API.
4. Users may add movies from the home page and the search feature to the favorites page.
5. Favorites page shows movies the user has selected to be more important - users may click on the poster to see a more detailed view of each movie.

Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](https://www.primeacademy.io/) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality.

Special thanks to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org) again! This was a lovely API to work with and had great documentation! My project this weekend wouldn't have been complete without access to this API!
